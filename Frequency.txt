└─────────────────────────────────────────► DOA (degrees)

Clustering Strategy:

client_111: Waits for 1500 pulses before clustering (batched)
client3: Clusters immediately after each window arrives (real-time)
Features:

client_111: Uses only DOA and frequency
client3: Uses all 4 features (adds pulse_width and PRI)
Eps parameter:

client_111: eps=0.3 (tight, strict)
client3: eps=0.8 (loose, flexible)
Buffer Management:

client_111: Manual list management
client3: Automatic with deque(maxlen=2500)
Scalability:

client3 is more efficient — real-time processing, cleaner code, uses StandardScaler which is more robust
